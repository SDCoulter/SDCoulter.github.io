          In this module we analysis car-based datasets using <strong>R</strong> and various statistical methods. Using automotive-based datasets we covered creating plots using <strong>ggplot2</strong>, formulating <strong>null and alternate hypotheses testing</strong>, and <strong>linear regression</strong>. We also briefly look at evaluating <strong>one- and two-sample t-tests</strong>, <strong>ANOVA</strong> (analysis of variance) models, and <strong>chi-squared tests</strong>. We also enter a discussion over <strong>A/B testing</strong> and determining the most appropriate statistical test for a given hypothesis and dataset.

          For this module we were working with to <strong>Tableau</strong>, an industry-leading <strong>data visualization</strong> application. We were supplied with a dataset of bicycle trips from the NYC service CitiBike - a bicycle sharing program based in New York. This dataset contained all the trips taken place in August 2019 and included a breakdown of the users and the trip lengths. We were tasked with <strong>analysing the data and presenting our findings</strong> using data visualizations built in Tableau.

          Our goal in this module was to create an interactive webpage that displayed earthquake data from the last 7 days. This data would be turned into circle markers that were overlaid on a map of the world and each marker's size and colour would be dependant on the magnitude of the corresponding earthquake. To do this we would pull the data in the <strong>GeoJSON</strong> format using the <strong>D3</strong> JavaScript module, and then display it on the map using the JavaScript module <strong>Leaflet</strong> which would make an API call to <strong>Mapbox</strong> for the map. We would create layers to display different maps and a number of different overlays for users to choose from.

          In this module we explored using the JavaScript libraries <strong>Plotly</strong> and <strong>D3</strong> to create dynamic graphs. We were given a dataset that contained the bacteria counts from a number of anonymised participants and were tasked with displaying it on a webpage for easy access and use. We read the data in using D3 and then used a dropdown menu on our page to choose each participant. We had a function run every time the choice in the drop down was changed, which redrew the graphs on the page. This meant our page was very interactive and the dynamic updates meant the user had no issuing navigating to their data.

We are running the analysis to show to the investor that the weather throughout the year will not affect this business being profitable year-round. Our goal being to convince the investor that investing is a wise choice and to support us creating our business.

Then we were able to plot graphs and perform linear regression analysis (please see the weather_data folder for images). As well as create heatmaps of the weather data we obtained from the OWM API, including Max Temperature, Humidity, and Cloudiness. Our interactions with the Google Maps API during the module included getting a list of hotels from these cities and plotting them on interactive maps, along with information boxes of weather information.

I am highly interested in data analysis and hope to put my curiosity and will to learn to the test as I work through this course.
